The Coalition for Smarter Buildings (C4SB), now part of the Linux Foundation as C4SBF, serves as an open-source initiative dedicated to revolutionizing building automation and IoT interoperability. It provides foundational reference models, standardized schemas, and open APIs designed to enable seamless data exchange across a diverse ecosystem of sensors, controls, software platforms, and vendor systems.

By fostering a collaborative community of manufacturers, software providers, integrators, and end-users. C4SBF accelerates the development and adoption of plug-and-play building technology, helping unlock smarter, more efficient, and future-proof building environments.
